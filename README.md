**Unnamed Twitch Bot**

I created this twitch bot as a way of practicing some JavaScript. Right now, it's current state is **In Development** as it is spaghetti code with very messy, tentative commands that were created just for testing. 

I started with using tmi.js and following their documentation. I browsed some examples of already created bots but didn't find anything that I was looking for, in terms of custom commands. Since I have experience creating advanced Discord bots, I used the previous knowledge gained from using APIs, node-fetch and axios and began to program commands. Right now, the bot has commands triggered by channel points and first time chatters. It also has language translation for various languages, random advice and a magic 8-ball. More commands to come as I find neat APIs to play around with. 

**Future Updates:**

 - [ ] Cleaner code
 - [ ] Commands separated into their own file for organization
 - [ ] More commands
 - [ ] *By Request* Command for every language, English to [Language] and [Language] to English (Might make a separate bot for this)
